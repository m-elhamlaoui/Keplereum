## Blockchain Infrastructure
The Keplereum blockchain infrastructure is designed as a private Ethereum network with multiple nodes for redundancy, fault tolerance, and distributed consensus. This infrastructure provides the immutable ledger for recording critical satellite events, alerts, confirmations, and actions.

### Private Ethereum Network
The Keplereum blockchain is implemented as a private Ethereum network with the following characteristics:

-   **Network ID**: 12345 (for testing)
-   **Consensus Algorithm**: Clique (Proof of Authority)
-   **Block Time**: 120 seconds
-   **Gas Limit**: 8,000,000
-   **Chain Specification**: EIP-155 enabled to prevent replay attacks

The genesis block defines the initial state of the blockchain and includes configuration for all Ethereum protocol upgrades already activated from genesis.

### Geth Nodes Configuration
The infrastructure consists of five Ethereum nodes running go-ethereum (geth) client. Each node has a specific role in the network:

![node_archi](./assets/node_archi.png)

All nodes have the following configuration:

-   **Network ID**: 12345
-   **Sync Mode**: Full
-   **Mining Enabled**: Yes (PoA consensus)
-   **Gas Price**: 0 (free transactions)
-   **Transaction Pool Size**: 1024 slots
-   **API Modules**: eth, net, web3, personal, miner, clique, txpool
- 
### Load Balancer
The Nginx load balancer distributes incoming blockchain requests across all available Geth nodes. This provides:

-   **High Availability**: If one node fails, requests are redirected to operational nodes
-   **Load Distribution**: Prevents any single node from becoming a bottleneck
-   **Single Entry Point**: Exposes a unified API endpoint (port 8550) for all blockchain services

The Blockchain Service microservice connects to this load balancer rather than directly to individual nodes, as specified in its configuration.

### Smart Contracts
The Keplereum blockchain utilizes the  `SatelliteSystem`  smart contract to manage satellite-related data and events. This contract handles:

1.  **Alert Management**:
    
    -   Submission of new alerts from satellites
    -   Confirmation of alerts by other satellites/ground stations
    -   Storage of alert metadata (type, coordinates, status)
2.  **Action Triggering**:
    
    -   Commands to satellites based on confirmed alerts
    -   Recording of all satellite actions on the blockchain
3.  **Validator Functions**:
    
    -   Operations related to network validators
    -   Management of consensus participants

## Monitoring Infrastructure

The blockchain infrastructure includes comprehensive monitoring tools:

1.  **Geth Exporter**:
    
    -   Collects metrics from Ethereum nodes
    -   Exposes metrics on port 6061
    -   Monitors address balances, block creation, and network status
2.  **Prometheus**:
    
    -   Scrapes metrics from the Geth Exporter
    -   Stores time-series data about blockchain performance
    -   Configured to monitor all aspects of the blockchain
3.  **Grafana**:
    
    -   Provides visualization dashboards for blockchain metrics
    -   Allows for real-time monitoring of network health
    -   Enables alerts based on performance thresholds

This monitoring setup ensures the operations team can maintain visibility into the blockchain's performance and health.
