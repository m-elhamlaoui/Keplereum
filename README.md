### Decentralized Satellite Communication Network Using Blockchain: A Secure and Scalable Microservices Architecture

---

### **Overview**
This project aims to design and implement a decentralized satellite communication system using blockchain technology to ensure secure, tamper-proof, and efficient data transmission between satellites and ground stations. The system will leverage a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and modularity, with a DevOps infrastructure for continuous integration and deployment. The front-end will provide a real-time monitoring dashboard for ground stations to track satellite communication, blockchain transactions, and network health.

### **Technologies Required**

#### **Blockchain and Backend**
- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum (for a public blockchain).
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (for Ethereum).
- **Backend**: Node.js / Spring Boot for microservices.
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing non-blockchain data.

#### **Microservices and DevOps**
- **Containerization**: Docker for packaging microservices.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing containers.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins or GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for system health monitoring.
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

#### **Frontend**
- **Framework**: React.js or Angular for building the monitoring dashboard.
- **Visualization**: D3.js or Chart.js for real-time data visualization.
- **WebSockets**: For real-time updates on the frontend.

#### **Simulation and Testing**
- **Network Simulation**: Cesium or Three.JS for simulating satellite groups.
- **Testing**: Jest / JUnit or Mockito for unit and integration testing.

### **Microservices and DevOps Infrastructure**

#### **Microservices Architecture**
1. **Satellite Communication Service**:
   - Handles communication between satellites and ground stations.
   - Validates and encrypts messages before sending them to the blockchain.

2. **Blockchain Service**:
   - Manages smart contracts for message validation and logging.
   - Interacts with the blockchain network (Ethereum).

3. **Authentication Service**:
   - Ensures only authorized satellites and ground stations can access the network.
   - Uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2 for secure authentication.

4. **Monitoring Service**:
   - Collects real-time data from satellites and ground stations.
   - Provides metrics for the frontend dashboard.

5. **Logging Service**:
   - Centralizes logs from all microservices for debugging and analysis.

#### **DevOps Infrastructure**
- **Version Control**: Git (GitHub/GitLab) for code management.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Automate testing, building, and deploying microservices using Jenkins or GitLab CI.
  - Use Docker to containerize each microservice.
  - Deploy containers to a Kubernetes cluster for orchestration.
- **Monitoring and Logging**:
  - Use Prometheus to collect metrics (e.g., CPU usage, latency).
  - Use Grafana to visualize metrics on the frontend dashboard.
  - Use the ELK Stack for centralized logging and log analysis.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
  - Use Terraform or Ansible to automate infrastructure setup (e.g., Kubernetes clusters, cloud resources).

### **Frontend for Monitoring**
The main front-end will be a real-time monitoring dashboard with the following features:

1. **Satellite Status**:
   - Display the health and location of each satellite in real-time.
   - Use a map to visualize satellite positions.

2. **Blockchain Transactions**:
   - Show a log of all transactions (messages) recorded on the blockchain.
   - Include details like sender, receiver, timestamp, and message content.

3. **Network Health**:
   - Display metrics like latency, bandwidth, and error rates.
   - Use graphs and charts (e.g., D3.js or Chart.js) for visualization.

4. **Alerts and Notifications**:
   - Notify ground stations of critical events (e.g., satellite malfunctions, collision warnings).
   - Use WebSockets for real-time updates.
